🚀 How to Use
Open the Notebook:
Launch visual_question_and_answering.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Upload an Image:
Upload an image that you want to ask a question about.

Ask a Question:
Provide a natural language question related to the image.
Example: "What is the boy holding?"

Run the Model:
The notebook will use a pre-trained VQA model (e.g., BLIP, LLaVA, or any HuggingFace-compatible model) to generate an answer.

🧠 Model Used
Uses the BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining) model via HuggingFace 🤗

Pre-trained on large vision-language datasets

Capable of understanding context from both image and text

🧪 Sample Demo

Image: A child holding a teddy bear
Question: What is the child holding?
Answer: A teddy bear
